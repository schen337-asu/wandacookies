once upon a bratwurst Karl befallen
a perfect b-road the Porsche drifts and conquers
a mighty Schloss along the seaside 
along came a wettbewerbsfaehig BMW in red  
in a Ratskeller roaring with warmth
where the Raesfeld roams Schloss with the Bunny
who by chance hopped through a baeckereifor apfelkuchen
and stoped to eat all the Hauptstrasse and wash it down with Biergarten
after its fill of Gebaeck it set out once more
There was an amazing Gebaeck smell.
